            My all time favorite book would probably be Forged by Fire by Sharon Draper. It's a story based out of Cincinnati about a young boy whose born into a bad situation and everytime something seemed to get better for him it'd just get worse. He find soluce in his younger half-sister whom he adores and fiercly protects. As their lives progress they look out for each other in an up and down tale that is their lives.

            My favorite Movie is Think Like A Man which is about a book that was published that allows a woman to see inside the mind of a male and why they do what they do and how to work with it. The movie follows 6 different couples with 6 different types of relationships that really does genually give good insite into the male mind. There is comedy, romance, and drama to the point you'll want to watch this movie again and again.

            Spaghetti is something I could eat all day everyday to the point you'd think I was a true Italian. I'm always cooking all kinds of different pasta dishes but my favorite kind would have to be standard spagetti noodles with a tomato meat sauce. Growing us it was one of the first dishes I learned to prepare all by myself when I was little.

            When people ask me what typ√üe of music I listen to I say my tastes range form Disney to Death Metal. I like all types of music although if I had to pick a favorite I'd have to say punk rock would probably be at the top of my list. Now for my favorite musician I put Chris Daughtry right at the top of my list who sings more rock than anything. I feel that that man could sing a McDonalds menu and it'd be a hit.

            Growing up my favorite colors ranged all the time from yellow to orange to red to blue but now I'd say that purple is my <a>favorite.</a>

              What relaxs me more than anything is being able to imerse myself in a good book. Loosing myself in a fictional world for any amount of time greatly improves my mood and helps me pass the time. I can start a good book, blink, and suddenly find that an hour has passed.

              Something that makes me happy these days is mainly being able to keep up in my school work. I also greatly enjoy spending time with my friends or enjoying one of my hobbies like baking or reading.

              Something interesting is that I greatly enjoying watching anime or reading manga. For those who don't know what that is its basically japanese cartoons or comic books. I also enjoy going to anime conventions and cosplaying as my favorite characters.
